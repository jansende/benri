# Roadmap
----------------------------------------
### 0.x.x
Future versions of *benri* might implement:
- `<chrono>` support
- `<algorithm>` support
- compile time math
- doxygen documentation
- extensive unit tests
- appveyor support



format docs
format tables
write about type lists

rename dimensions to dimension
add chrono
